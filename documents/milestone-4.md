# Milestone 4: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Final Design
<!-- ( / 10) Provide a brief summary on how the final prototype focuses on addressing users' problems, value propositions, and scenarios identified earlier. There is no excessive function built.

( / 5) Provide a brief summary on how the app is designed for your persona(s). -->

Our final design focuses on the value of community and memories. Many of our initial interviews suggested that people have very fond memories of the farmers market, and their memories of the scenery, vendors, and people there is what motivates them to return. Our PWA focuses on just that -- it encourages people to document their memories as well as make new ones.

The two main features of our prototype are the flower garden gallery and the challenges list. Users of our app encounter two main screens: the flower garden, and the challenges list. Our users cherish their memories of the Farmer's Market, but over time they tend to fade. With our app, they are encouraged to explore new things at the Farmer's Market and then record those memories via the challenges list. Afterwards, those memories live on as flowers in their garden.

- We took various "activities" that our users mentioned enjoying at the farmers market and ones that were memorable to them, and turned them into a list of "tasks" for our users to complete, while taking a picture of them doing so.

- This method of suggestion will help users be able to capture and collect memories, while giving them opportunities to become more immersed in the special community that is formed within the farmers market. The images captured are stored in a garden collection so that users will be easily reminded of the memories that they cherish.

As described in milestone 2, our value proposition has two main parts:

- All farmers market-related photos in one place (as opposed to looking through all photos or manually organize photos into an album).
- Suggestions of activities to do to create (and document) even more positive memories at the farmers market.

With regards to our value proposition:

- Our prototype's gallery feature ensures that photo memories relating to the Farmer's Market are all in one place, compared to the user having to manually search for photos in their smartphone's camera roll.
- Our prototype's challenges feature gives the user a list of suggested activities to complete and mark as completed by taking a photo.

Our app directly addresses our persona Mary's goals: retaining her positive memories of the farmers market and seeking out new things to do (i.e. making new memories). These are addressed with the flower garden gallery and challenges list, respectively. 

The flower garden, which contains a gallery of images with timestamps, will help Mary jog her memory of the fond memories that she is beginning to forget after so many visits. Additionally, since Mary can become stuck in a routine, the Challenges page is geared towards getting Mary out of her comfort zone and encouraging her to record new memories by exploring new things.
