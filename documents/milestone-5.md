# Milestone 5: Evaluation & Deployment

## Evaluation
- Summary of user testing plan
- Raw User Testing Notes
- Evaluation
- Design Revision

#### Procedure:
User testing followed the same procedure as our prior testing.  We reached out to different users than last time to better assess the intuitiveness of our design.  We asked each user to talk aloud and go through our two scenarios (Milestone 3): 1) Browse to see what you did during your last visit, and 2) Try something new and [insert Challenges task].  Since our target audience is Ithaca residents, we wanted to use these scenarios to gauge whether the app would help our user recall their farmers market visits (Scenario 1) and motivate them to try new things (Scenario 2).  We took notes and made evaluations based on their verbal narration and comments in addition to how they interacted with the app.
During our user testing, we opted to take notes on our laptops because it is quick and more legible to share the artifact with team members who were not present at the testing session. 


#### Testing:
- Raw notes for user 1
![raw notes 1](images/user1.png)
- Debrief 1
    - For user 1, they liked to have feedback on the controls to confirm on what they are doing is "correct"
    - They also needed feedback on certain things like the pictures in the gallery for more intuitive interaction
    - It turns out that clicking onto a memory in their garden was not intuitive and the user did not complete task 1 because of it
- Key Issues
    - Did not immediately understand the concept of the garden and did not receive enough feedback from the app to navigate it efficiently.

- Raw notes for user 2

- Debrief 2
    - User 2 enjoyed the simplicity of our app
    - They liked the idea of challenges and expressed that it would get them to try and do more activities at the farmers market, creating more memories
    - They suggested we play with the idea of time, by using garden growth as a way to depict the age of the memory
        - This can be something simple to help users get a sense of how much time a memory has on it
- Key Issues:
    - Wants more activity and action in the app for better engagement, particularly regarding number of tasks and growing flower/garden analogy.

- Raw notes for user 3
![raw notes 3](images/user3.png)
- Debrief 3
    - The garden screen is not very intuitive for this user
    - Since it was the first screen they say, they assumed it was the home screen and tried to click onto a memory, which worked, but because that first interaction was not clear, they were unsure with what else they could do when viewing the memory so they clicked around in hopes of finding something
    - The link between challenges and their garden is unclear to them, and they would like to see the garden to be more like a garden (look like one)
- Key Issues:
    - Needs to be a clearer sense of navigation/home structure, with a stronger coherence between challenges and flowers.

- Raw notes for user 4

- Debrief 4
    - User 4 pointed out to us that some people will not have an incentive to use this app because they could just use a camera on their phone (and not use our app to store the picture in the garden)
    - One way to incentivize people is to make their flower collection sharable, kind of like a status, to share to their social media
- Key Issues:
    - Lacks motivation from user to use the app, thus needs a stronger, more enticing garden metaphor.

- Raw notes for user 5
![raw notes 5](images/user5.png)
- Debrief 5
    - User 5 liked the idea of our app but wished that the garden was more intuitive at the beginning
    - When doing task 1, the user was reminded about a memory that they had while they were at the Farmers Market themselves which shows us that these memories help with remembering stories users had at the Farmers Market
- Key Issues
    - Starting on the garden page doesn't give the user a clear, immediate sense of action and purpose.

Summary of issues:
- Overall, users had difficulty figuring out what the garden was at the beginning (particularly users 1, 3, 5). The function is not as intuitive as the challenges function which is to be expected because it might not be something they have seen as much before.  
- On the other hand, the challenges function might be something they may have encountered before, such as objectives/tasks in games 
- Users also prefer to have feedback and indicators on the screen to know what is clickable.  User 3 particularly showcased this issue as they spent a lot of time clicking around just to test what was a function.
- Users wished to have the ability to retake photos, as well as have a social component by sharing their garden to social media (Users 3, 4)
- Lastly, while most users like the idea of the app, they would like to see the theme of owning a garden more apparent throughout the app (Users 1-5)

- For the changes to the Figma wireframe, we added/ revised:
    - A short description to help people understand what they are supposed to do on each screen
    - Added titles and timestamps of each memory flower so users know which memory it is
    - Added the ability to change the colors/ shape of the frame
    - Tried to incorporate a garden theme thoughout the app
    - Gave users the ability to share to social media
    - Gave users the ability to retake the photo
