# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

    - If a team member consistently fails to deliver, the other teammates will assign them non-essential work each week


8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - If we cannot come to a unanimous agreement, we will institute a majority vote for conflict resolution

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - We will voice concerns about the contract via Facebook messenger (or in person) and re-visit the contract whenever a member requests to do so. 
    - All changes must be agreed upon by the majority of team members.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - Grab a beer after every milestone!
