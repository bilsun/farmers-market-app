# Milestone 2: Discovery & Exploration

## Interview Notes

Semi-structured interview tactics:
- Went to the Farmer's Market and interviewed patrons / Ithaca residents
- Interviewed students and faculty on campus as well
- We chose to collect data this way because we wanted to delve into a patron's thoughts about their farmer's market experience 
    - By asking questions directly, we have the opportunity to ask them to clarify their answers (if they were vague) to deeper understand why they behave the way they do at the farmer's market
    - Semi-structured interviews also provide the flexibility for us to delve into new topics or issues that come up over the course of the in-person interviews
- We chose not to do field studies because we were afraid that if patrons knew that they were being watched, it might affect their actual behavior

Interview notes:

* **Swim Team**
    * ![Swim team notes](images/swimteam.png)
    * Summary of user: 
        * Four female undergraduate Cornell students sitting at a table before practice. They are two sophomores and two seniors. They go to the farmers market spontaneuously, and only go a handful of times per season. They typically spend around two to three hours at the farmers market when they do go. They go for the brunch options, and to enjoy the sunshine while sitting around the dock.
    * What was learned:
        * These users have specific things they go to the farmers market for (e.g. cinnamon rolls). Frustrations include long lines and payment methods. Despite these frustrations, they still enjoy the atmosphere and scenery of the farmers market.

* **Ithaca Residents**
    * ![Ithaca residents notes](images/ithaca_residents_1.png)
    * ![Ithaca residents notes](images/ithaca_residents_2.png)
    * Summary of users:
        * Two female Ithaca residents sitting on the dock at the farmer's market. They have been frequenting the market regularly for years and enjoy going for brunch or local produce. They typically spend several hours at the farmer's market meandering, eating, and chatting with each other.
    * What was learned:
        * Ithaca residents aren't rushed at the farmer's market but avoid crowds when possible. They tend to emphasize the positive aspects of the famers market since they've been going so long (more than 10 years in this case) and have so many fond memories of it.

* **Beth**
    * ![Beth notes](images/beth.png)
    * ![Beth notes](images/beth2.png)
    *  Summary of user: 
        * Beth is an administrative faculty member of Cornell University who frequents the farmer's market a bit less than once a month.  While she usually goes to Wegmans to shop for all her needs, she will attend the farmer's market with her husband mainly to browse for fresh produce.  She enjoys the atmosphere and quality of products, but dislikes huge crowds and lines and difficult parking.
    * What was learned: 
        * The most positive experiences at the farmer's market involve taking the time to stroll and enjoy the atmosphere, buying fresh produce, and avoiding crowds.


* **Julie**
    * ![Julie notes](images/julie.png)
    * Summary of user: 
        * Julie is not actually a resident of Ithaca. She is from Rochester. However, she often goes to the farmer's market to buy fresh and organic produce for her toddler. When she goes to the farmer's market, she befriends the vendors and tries to get the best deal she can. She likes to to a first pass walk through the farmer's market, and compare price and quality between the vendors before she makes her purchases. She is frustrated by the crowd and sometimes stalls are too busy, so she ends up leaving the line. 
    * What was learned: 
        * Even non-Ithaca residents (who don't visit the Ithaca farmers market as often) still have positive memories of it. In this case, the user's favorite memory was getting to know a farmer at one of the stalls.

* **Mercedes**
    * ![Mercedes notes](images/mercedes.png)
    * Summary of user:
        * She is a student from Ithaca. She doesn't normally go to the farmer's market, but when she does it is for the food and to socialize with others. She really likes the setting of the farmer's market (view of lakes). She tends to walk around and sees what is good. If something piques her interest, she will go check out the vendor. One thing that determines whether or not she goes is because of the weather. 
    * What was learned:
        * People go to the farmer's market to hang out and socialize. Going to the farmer's market is like an event and you end up being there for a few hours enjoying yourself and making positive memories.

* **Prof. Jery Stedinger**
    * ![Jery notes](images/jery.png)
    * Summary of user: 
        * Jery has been living in Ithaca for several decades and has worked in Cornell's College of Engineering for 42 years. He is very familiar with local history and knows about nearly everything Ithaca has to offer.
    * What was learned: 
        * Some Ithaca residents do not visit the market very frequently (usually 2 or 3 times a year). This user's favorite things about the market were the Ithaca souvenirs (paintings, woodworking) and unique foods like Belgian waffles, which he had very strong memories of despite not visiting the market within the past year.

* **Cornell Student**
    * ![Cornell student notes](images/studentnote.png)
    * Summary of user:
        * She is a Cornell student who goes to the farmer's market a few times a year. She mainly goes to get apple cider donuts and Vietnamese food. She has to go out of her way to get cash before she goes, but says that it is worth it because the food is so good. She dislikes that the farmer's market is so far away and that some vendors are expensive. She also says that the farmer's market is very crowded and that the popularity of some vendors make walking through the market kind of difficult. 
    * What was learned:
        * Two problems identified by this user were transportation and high prices. Some of the positive aspects mentioned were the atmosphere, good food, socializing with friends, and playing with dogs at the farmers market.

## Affinity Diagramming

![affinity diagramming](images/affinity_diagramming.jpg)

### Clusters & Insights (What We Learned)
- Reasons for visiting
    - Atmosphere
        - People enjoy the scenic atmosphere, nice weather, local vendors, making positive memories
        - These memories can become hazy and unclear with time
    - Friends
        - People like going with their friends and socializing
    -  General positives
        - High quality groceries and yummy food

- Navigation
    - Website
        - Some use it, some do not. When used, mostly for checking logistics (where / when)
    - Physical (pathfinding at the market)
        - Most people do not have a concrete strategy
        - Prefer to wander around, not in a rush. Meandering

- Issues
    - ATM/Money
        - Most people know they need to bring cash
        - Either they do not know because it’s their first time, or they forgot to bring cash
        - Usually someone with them will pay in cash

    - Parking
        - A big issue. A lot of people find it inconvenient and annoying.

    - Crowded
        - People hate waiting in line.
        - A busy farmer’s market can feel nice, but means long lines and waiting times
        - People will give up on a line / purchase and just move to another stall

    - Communication with vendors
        - Vendor selection is inconsistent. They don’t know who’s going to be there.

- Time & Frequency
    - People freely walk around and accidentally spend 2-3 hours at the farmer’s market. Being there is time-consuming.
    - Most people don’t go very often (usually just 1-3 times a year) except for a dedicated few who get their groceries there because they like local produce

## After the interviews and affinity diagramming…

- What are the problems that we identify?
    - ATM/money (forgetting to bring cash)
    - Parking can be difficult to find
    - Crowdedness (waiting in long lines)
    - Vendors change unexpectedly
    - Good memories fade and/or become hazy

## Key Problems
- Key Problem:
    - People have great memories of the Ithaca farmers market but no concrete way to document and reminisce about them. Because of this, good memories can become hazy or even forgotten over time.

NOTE: we first focused on crowdedness and vendors changing unexpectedly as our key problems, but changed our focus due to instructor feedback about scope of the assignment

## Value Propositions

- Addressing the key problem: Memories Fade

    - Specific alternatives to review memories from the farmers market
        - Camera app and camera roll/photo albums
            - Primarily to view existing images
        - Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook (or other image-based social media) 
            - Images with more time-based logging and annotations

    - Compared to these alternatives, our app provides:
        1. All farmers market-related photos in one place (as opposed to looking through all photos or manually organize photos into an album)
            - This helps paint a more holistic picture of users' memories at the farmers market
            - Providing more visible captions/descriptions/timestamps also helps jog users' memories of the farmers market, preventing them from forgetting important moments (key problem)
        2. Suggestions of activities to do to create (and document) even more positive memories at the farmers market
            - Prompting users to document new memories also helps them better reminisce and remember their experiences at the farmers market (key problem)

### Costs or barriers
-  The costs of our app may include: 
    - The learning curve
        -  Our app is slightly different from a traditional camera/photo app, so users may have to familiarize themselves with the controls
    - Changing routines and habits
        - Many of our interviewees say that they mostly roam around freely and go to whichever booth piques their interest (don't typically use their phones much)
        - Users may have to be incentivized to take out their phone to document memories when they may not otherwise

## Scenarios
- Mary, an Ithaca native, visits the farmers market several times a year. She has fond memories of the market and the community there. However, as time passes and she visits more, her memories start to blur together and become hazy. One day, as she visits a booth she's not sure she's visited before, Mary realizes she would like a way to retain these memories of the Ithaca farmers market so she can cherish them for longer.
    - Relates to value proposition 1

- Mary, an Ithaca native, visits the farmers market several times a year. She has a fairly set routine and always visits the Cambodian Food vendor to order the #7 chicken. As she eats her #7 chicken for the 4th time this month, Mary realizes she would like to branch out and try a new activity at the farmers market.
    - Relates to value proposition 2

## Personas

- **Name**: Mary
- **Age**: 34
- **Description**:  

    Mary is an Ithaca resident who has been living in the area for the past six years and values her community. She goes to the farmer's market around five times a year without planning much beforehand. Mary is very comfortable and familiar with the farmers market and knows her way around interacting with different booths and activities. She spends on average two hours with her friend to have a leisurely brunch, select fresh produce, and engage with the community there. She always has her phone on her in case she needs to get in touch with her friend remotely or look something up on the Internet. Sometimes when Mary is wandering around the Farmers Market, she wants to remember times when she was there years ago, but the pictures she took at the time are no longer on her phone. 

    However, as much as she enjoys the farmers market, her memories of it tend to fade or become hazy over time. It is these memories and moments that she wants to improve her recollection of, as well as cultivate new memories that she can reminisce about later. 

- **Main Goals**:  Mary wants to retain her positive memories of the farmers market and seek out new things to do (i.e. make new memories) at the same time. 

## Project themes (MPS only)
- Intended for mobile use. All functions are accessible on a smartphone-sized screen, and images and assets are sized appropriately.
    - Note: when using the website on an actual smartphone, the camera functionality does not work properly even though it was implemented properly according to the HTML5 API's standards. This was cleared with Professor Harms.
- Exploration: users are encouraged to try specific new activities and cultivate / document those activities at the farmers market.
    - Users should document suggested activities they haven't tried before
- Reflection: users can reflect on and cherish their old memories from the farmer's market.
    - Details like date, relative time, name of task, and the image should be available to help with this reflection
